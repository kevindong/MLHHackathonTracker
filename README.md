# MLH Hackathon Tracker

[MLH's webpage](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2017/events) listing all the hackathons going on in a particular year does not list the hackathons in the order in which they are announced. Meaning, it's difficult to see know which hackathons just appeared on the list. It'd be nice to know which hackathon you haven't yet looked at. Well, that's what this script does.

## Instructions

You should use Python 3.x.

You may need to install the `requests` and `lxml` library. The easiest way is to run `pip3.x install requests && pip3.x install lxml` where 3.x stands for the current version of Python 3 that you have installed. Only replace the `x`. Obviously, you'll also need to have Python 3 installed. 

To use this script, just open up terminal, `cd` into the appropriate directory, and then type `python3 MLH_Hackathon_Tracker.py`.
