# MLH Hackathon Tracker

[MLH's webpage](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2017/events) listing all the hackathons going on in a particular year does not list the hackathons in the order in which they are announced. Meaning, it's difficult to see know which hackathons just appeared on the list. It'd be nice to know which hackathon you haven't yet looked at. Well, that's what this script does.
